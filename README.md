# Badass Geometric Stripe Patterns :fire::gun::unicorn:

Create awesome geometric patterns using triangles and some clever canvas manipulation

# Install
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/8-uh/stripe-patterns
$ cd stripe-patterns
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

# Controls
1. There's some sliders
2. Also some toggles maybe?
3 .A few input boxes I think
4. `F1` will hide the control panel all-together...

SO YOU CAN TAKE PANTS-RUININGLY AWESOME SCREENSHOTS AND SEND THEM TO
YOUR LONELY-ASS MOTHER. TELL HER YOU MADE THEM, BECAUSE, I GUESS, TECHNICALLY YOU DID. BESIDES, SHE WON'T QUESTION IT. SHE (PRESUMABLY) LOVES YOU. SHE'S JUST RELIEVED YOU'RE NOT WITH THAT TAYLOR GIRL/BOY ANYMORE. THEY WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU ANY WAY. LOOK, I KNOW IT STILL HURTS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, BUT YOU GOTTA MOVE ON ONE DAY, WHY NOT TODAY?!


My point is... call your mother... she misses you.
